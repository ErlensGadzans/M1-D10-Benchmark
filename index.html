            True adventure takes guts, so KTM’s rally experts brought out the
            big guns and packed 1.301cc, 140 Nm of torque and 160 hp into the
            world’s most advanced Travel Enduro chassis. This makes for a
            mile-munching omnivore, ready to carve its name into any terrain –
            the tougher, the better. It is our most extreme ADVENTURE ever, full
            stop. Full throttle.

              Introduced back in 1998, the Yamaha YZF-R1 was the bike to spark
              the imagination of many riders as the century drew to a close. In
              those days, the R1 was known as one of the highest power (140
              crank HP) and fastest (0-60 in 2.9 seconds) bikes you could buy.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Coming into the 2020 model year, the R1 has had 6 generations to
              develop new technology and features, which come into play with
              things such as anti-slide, anti-wheelie, offset crossplane 4
              cylinder firing inline engine (refined with input from both MotoGP
              riders Valnetino Rossi and Maverick Vinales), throttle-by-wire
              (new for 2020), and a host of other top-model systems including
              optional clutchless upshifts (QuickShift in Yamaha’s
              nomenclature). The R1 is still known as one of the highest power
              supersport bikes with power coming in at 198 crank HP (with
              optional 199 HP in track mode).
